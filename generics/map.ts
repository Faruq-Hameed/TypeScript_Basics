// Map type
// Mapped types are a powerful feature of TypeScript 
// that allows you to create new types by transforming the properties of an existing type. 
// It is a way of mapping the keys of one object to another object. 
// It can be used to create new types that are more specific or to modify an existing type 
// by adding, updating, or deleting properties.
// Mapped types can be used with any object type. 
// They work by iterating over the keys of the object and creating 
// a new object with the same keys but with new types.

type Properties = 'propA' | 'propB';

// type M
